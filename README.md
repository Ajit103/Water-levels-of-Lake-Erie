# Water-levels-of-Lake-Erie
The “LakeErie.csv” data gives the year, month and water levels in tens of metres above sea level for Lake Erie from 1967 to 2016. Levels have been somewhat high lately and if water levels get too high, there is a risk of flooding. On the other hand, if water levels get too low, shorelines start to recede.
